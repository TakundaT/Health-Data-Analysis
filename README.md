# Global Health Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of global health data to uncover trends and insights regarding various factors such as healthcare access, urbanization rate, mortality rate, and their interrelations. The project employs Python libraries for data visualization and statistical analysis to better understand the factors influencing health outcomes across different regions. The CSV file is too big to be put on Github so the link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malaiarasugraj/global-health-statistics

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: Generates scatter plots, histograms, and other visualizations to interpret the data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explores relationships between variables such as healthcare access, urbanization rate, and recovery/mortality rates.
- **Statistical Insights**: Provides quantitative analysis of relationships using metrics like correlation coefficients.
- **Custom Insights**: Helps derive actionable insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `matplotlib`: For creating scatter plots, histograms, and other charts.
  - `seaborn`: For enhanced data visualization and statistical plotting.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.

## Visualizations
### Example Plots
- **Healthcare Access vs. Recovery Rate**: Explores the relationship between healthcare access and recovery rates, with scatter plots indicating the strength and direction of correlation.
- **Urbanization Rate vs. Healthcare Access**: Assesses how urbanization rates correlate with access to healthcare facilities.
- **Distribution of Mortality Rate**: Displays the spread of mortality rates across regions, providing insights into patterns or uniformity in the data.

## Usage
1. **Setup**:
   - Install Python (>=3.7) and clone this repository.
   - Install dependencies using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
2. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`*.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, generate plots, and perform analysis.
3. **Visualize Results**:
   - Generated plots and statistical insights will be displayed within the notebook.

## Files
- `Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb`: Contains all code for data exploration and visualization.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset(s) used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for the project.

## Insights
- The analysis helps identify key factors impacting global health, such as the effect of urbanization on healthcare accessibility or how healthcare access influences recovery rates.
- The distribution of mortality rates offers a baseline for identifying potential regions of concern.

## Future Work
- **Advanced Models**: Implement machine learning models to predict health outcomes.
- **Expanded Datasets**: Incorporate additional datasets to include more health indicators.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Build interactive visualizations for real-time data exploration.
